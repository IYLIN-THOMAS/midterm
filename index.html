        <h2> Life of a dolphin </h2>
        <img src="IMAGE/dolphin-image.jpg"  alt="Friendly dolphins"  title="Friendly dolphins">
        <p> Dolphins (Odontoceti) are a group of 44 species of toothed whales or cetaceans. There are dolphins in every ocean on Earth,
            and there are freshwater species of dolphins that inhabit rivers in South Asian and South American. The largest dolphin species 
            (the orca) grows to more than 30 feet long while the smallest, Hector's dolphin, is just 4.5 feet in length. Dolphins are well known
            for their intellect, their gregarious nature, and their acrobatic abilities. But there are many lesser-known qualities that make a
            dolphin a dolphin.Dolphins are small-toothed Cetaceans, a group of marine mammals that evolved from land mammals. They have developed 
            numerous adaptations that make them well suited for life in water including a streamlined body, flippers, blowholes and a layer of 
            blubber for insulation.Dolphins have curved beaks which means they appear to have permanent smiles. Dolphins evolved from land 
            mammals whose legs were underneath their bodies.As a result, dolphins tails move up and down as they swim, whereas a fish’s tail 
            moves from side to side.Dolphins, like all toothed whales, lack olfactory lobes and nerves. Because dolphins do not possess these
            anatomical features, they most likely have a poorly developed sense of smell.The snout of some oceanic dolphins is long and slender
            due to their elongated, prominent jaw bones. Within the dolphins' elongated jaw bone sits numerous conical teeth (some species have 
            as many as 130 teeth in each jaw). Species that have prominent beaks include, for example, Common Dolphin, Bottlenose Dolphin,
            Atlantic Humpbacked Dolphin, Tucuxi, Long-Snouted Spinner Dolphin, and numerous others.The forelimbs of a dolphin are anatomically
            equivalent to the forelimbs of other mammals (for example, they are analogous to arms in humans). But the bones within the forelimbs
            of dolphins have been shortened and made more rigid by supporting connective tissue. Pectoral flippers enable dolphins to steer and 
            modulate their speed.The dorsal fin of a dolphin (located on the back of the dolphin) acts as a keel when the animal swims, giving the
            animal directional control and stability within the water. But not all dolphins have a dorsal fin. For example, the Northern Rightwhale
            Dolphins and the Southern Rightwhale Dolphins lack dorsal fins. Dolphins do not have prominent external ear openings. Their ear 
            openings are small slits (located behind their eyes) which do not connect to the middle ear. Instead, scientists suggest that sound 
            is conducted to the inner and middle ear by fat-lobes located within the lower jaw and by various bones within the skull.</p>

       <h3> Facts about dolphins </h3>
          <ul>
               <li>Dolphins are marine mammals that must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young.</li>
               <li>A dolphin pregnancy lasts between nine and 16 months.</li>
               <li>Dolphins are graceful, sleek swimmers that can reach speeds of more than 18 miles an hour.</li>
               <li>They are also playful and often frolic in a boat’s wake, leaping out of the water—possibly
                    for fun, to communicate, or even shed pesky parasites.</li>
